# What is FastStore?
It is an evolution of the Legacy CMS Portal. This new solution was built to be the new way to create and deploy showcases, aiming to meet the new demands of customers, making possible the highest customization based on [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) frameworks.

Examples of platforms that use Jamstack:
* [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

This new solution follows the principles of [Composable Commerce](https://vtex.com/en/blog/technology/composable-commerce-the-new-era-of-digital-transformation/) that is on the rise in the international market

# Key Points
By using Jamstack, it is possible to avoid some problems that customers, especially developers, were facing:
1. Performance problems
   * Use of Legacy CMS Portal and VTEX IO hinder solutions that need high performance; ❌
   * Jamstack is constantly used for high performance demands. ✅
2. Store Framework Limitations
   * Because it is a proprietary solution, customers depend on decisions made internally at the technology level and at the patch level; ❌
   * With the migration to FastStore, Jamstack enables more subsidies, with an emphasis on the open source community and less instability. ✅
